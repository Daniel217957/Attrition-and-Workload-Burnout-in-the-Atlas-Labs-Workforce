## Project Context
Burnout results from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. It involves feelings of energy depletion, increased mental distance from one’s job, and reduced professional efficacy. While attrition (the natural departure of employees) is expected in any business, high turnover driven by burnout is a critical metric. This is typically measured using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as attrition rate, average tenure, and reported job satisfaction scores.

Excessive workload, frequent business travel, and lack of work-life balance often predispose employees to burnout, leading to voluntary resignation and loss of institutional knowledge.

In this project, the Human Resources (HR) dataset for Atlas Labs was utilized, comprising comprehensive employee records including demographics, job roles, and performance metrics. The data was cleaned, filtered, and analyzed to isolate employees who had left the organization (Attrition = "Yes") to uncover patterns connecting overtime, salary hikes, and job satisfaction with their decision to leave. This work was conducted to demonstrate the application of people analytics in solving business problems.

Using Power BI, I developed an interactive and visually intuitive dashboard that produced several valuable insights on workforce dynamics at Atlas Labs and proffered data-driven retention strategies to mitigate burnout and reduce the financial impact of employee attrition.
